Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Obtain bioactivity data from ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
. Build ML models to predict bioactivity (EC50) and drugability (ADME)
. Run Molecular docking using the glide module of Schrodinger
. Run molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) using Desmond module of Schrodinger
