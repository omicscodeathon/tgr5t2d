Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
.A: MACHINE LEARNING: Download bioactivity data of compounds with biological activity for TGR5 from ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
. Clean the data: select those with EC50 values, remove those with redundant bioactivity values and those without SMILE notations
. Label compounds as either active (with EC50 values < 1uM), inactive (with EC50 values > 10uM) or intermediate (with values in between actives and inactives)
. Remove interediate category for analysis focused only on active and inactive compounds
. Compute molecular descriptors based on Lipinski's rule of five (ADME)
. To allow for EC50 data to be more uniformly distributed, convert EC50 to negative logarithimic scale to give pEC50
. Build ML model using random forest algorithm to predict bioactivity (EC50) and drugability (ADME)
. Generate fingerorint descriptors using PaDEL
. Remove features with low variance 
. Divide dataset into 80:20 ratio for training purposes
. Screen the Coconut database
. B: MOLECULAR DOCKING: Prepare the ligands usign the ligPrep module of the Schrodinger software.
. Download the TGR5 protein form Protein Data Bank, and prepare using the Protein Preparation Wizard of the Schrodinger software.
. Create a grid box where the ligands will be docked in the proetein (active site) 
. Run docking using the glide module of Schrodinger
. visualize the docking results
. C: MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION: Set up the system by adding ions and a memberane to the protein-ligand complex 
. Execute the simulation run for 100 ns using the Desmond module of Schrodinger software
. Do post simulation trajectory analysis
.visualize the simulation results
