## Background
Diabetes is a major health burden worldwide, and the development of novel and effective therapies is crucial for improving patient outcomes.
A promising new class of medications for the management of type 2 diabetes is TGR5 agonists. Since it has been demonstrated that activating TGR5 receptors improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure, these receptors are a desirable target for diabetes treatment.
TGR5 agonists have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics for the management of type 2 diabetes. Activation of TGR5 receptors has been shown to increase energy expenditure and improve glucose homeostasis, making them an attractive target for diabetes treatment.
The development of novel TGR5 agonists holds great promise for diabetes treatment. These agonists have the potential to not only regulate glucose levels but also address other important aspects of diabetes management, such as body weight and associated complications. In addition, the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion by TGR5 agonists can lead to improved glycemic control through glucose-dependent insulin secretion.



## Objectives

1. To Develop machine learning models to predict potential TGR5 agonist based on bioactivity data from Chembl
2. Identify lead compounds that could serve as potential drugs; this will be achived by carrying out molecular docking to dtermine the binding affinity of the compound(s) to the target protein.
3. Determine the stability of the binding of the compound(s) to the target protein, through Molecular Dynamics Simulations

## Data
The data that was used for machine learning modelling in this study was obtained from (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/g/#search_results/all/query=TGR5). The training dataset used in the study is in (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/g/#search_results/targets/query=tgr5%0A)



## Methods
### Workflow

### 1.Machine Learning


### 2.Molecular Docking 
Molecular docking predicts the preferred orientation of a small molecule to a protein target to form a stable complex.

### 3.Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS)
This is a computational method used to examine how atoms and molecules behave over time. Using Newton's equations of motion, MDS determines the stability,  typically tracking the positions and velocities of atoms as they evolve in accordance with classical mechanics. This makes it possible for scientists to look into the atomic-level dynamic features of molecular systems.
